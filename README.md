# Tic Tac Toe

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe console application. I made this mostly to practice writing a game loop and documented, clean code. Looking back at my Codex project, the Python and Javascript I have in there doesn't seem that well-documented or organized (at least, to me).

# Usage

Type in `make release` and then `./tic_tac_toe` to run it in the console. `make clean` cleans up all object files and executables.
